The eigenvector is a non-zero vector that changes by a factor, when A is multiplied to it. In other words, if A is a square matrix and v is a non-zero vector, then Av is an eigenvector of A if v is also an eigenvector of A, and the scalar factor by which v is multiplied is the eigenvalue associated with that eigenvector. The set of all eigenvectors of a matrix, along with their corresponding eigenvalues, provides a complete set of solutions to the matrix equation (Av = λv), where λ is the eigenvalue.\\n\\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors are important in many areas of mathematics and science, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics, as they can be used to diagonalize matrices, analyze the behavior of dynamic systems, and find the principal components of data. They also play a crucial role in the study of linear transformations and linear operators.'"

It's a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\\n\\nMachine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it's too difficult or time-consuming for humans to explicitly program instructions.\\n\\nThere are three main types of machine learning:\\n\\n1. Supervised learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is provided for each input. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that generalizes well to unseen data. Examples include regression, classification, and structured prediction.\\n\\n2. Unsupervised learning: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where no correct output is provided. The goal is to find patterns or structure in the data. Examples include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\\n\\n3. Reinforcement learning: The model learns to interact with an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Examples include game playing, robotics, and recommendation systems.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms are typically based on mathematical optimization techniques, and they require large amounts of data to train effectively. The field of machine learning is rapidly evolving, with new algorithms, techniques, and applications being developed all the time.\""

Pi has been known since ancient times and is used in various mathematical and scientific formulas.\\n\\nTo find the value of pi, you can use various methods, such as measuring the circumference and diameter of a circle, or using mathematical equations. However, due to its irrational nature, the value of pi cannot be expressed exactly as a finite decimal or fraction. Instead, it is often approximated to a certain number of decimal places, such as 3.14 or 3.14159 (the first 7 decimal places).\\n\\nIn Python, you can use the `math` module to get an approximation of pi:\\n\\n```python\\nimport math\\npi_value = math.pi\\nprint(pi_value)\\n```\\n\\nThis will output the value of pi to approximately 16 decimal places:\\n\\n```\\n3.141592653589793\\n```\"}\n"
